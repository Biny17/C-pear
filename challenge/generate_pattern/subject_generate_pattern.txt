Objective:
Implement a function that generates a pattern using a given character and stores it in a dynamically allocated buffer. 
The pattern should contain a specified number of characters per line and a specified number of lines.

    Mode1: You may use array indexing.
    Mode2: You must use pointer arithmetic only.


Allowed Functions:
malloc, free


Function Signature:
size_t generate_Pattern(char c, int per_line, int lines, char** buffer);


-Example:
Input: c = '*', per_line = 3, lines = 2
Process:
- Allocate buffer: 2 lines, each 3 '*' + '\n' = 8 bytes
- Write: "***\n***\n"
Output: *buffer = "***\n***\n", return 8
